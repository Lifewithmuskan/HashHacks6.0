# Heart Health Analyzer

## Overview
The Heart Health Analyzer is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing cardiac assessment by leveraging technology and machine learning. Using hardware sensors and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the project aims to analyze heart-related data and provide precise assessments of cardiac health.

## Features
- **Capture heart-related data** using hardware sensors
- **Process data with a CNN model** for cardiac assessment
- **Determine heart health status** and categorize into different conditions

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install the required dependencies** using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Connect the hardware sensors** according to the provided instructions.
4. **Run the main script** `imageclassifcation.py` to start the application.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the **hardware sensors are properly connected** and functioning.
2. **Run the application** and follow the on-screen instructions to capture heart-related data.
3. The **CNN model will process the data** and provide an assessment of cardiac health.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ECG monitor or compatible heart rate sensor**
